# Prism Control

A simple app that allows you to select the color and effect for a WS2812B LED strip, controlled by an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi. The app establishes a connection via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) between your smartphone and the Arduino controller, sending the selected data upon command.



## Features

- Select Color
- Select Effect
- Select Speed
- Live previews

## Installation

Currently, installing iOS apps that aren't on the App Store can be challenging. IF you have XCode your can deploy your app by yourself.

### Using XCode

1. **Download and Install Xcode:** If you don't have Xcode installed on your computer, download and install it from the [official Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

2. **Connect your iOS Device:** Use a USB cable to connect your iPhone to your computer.

3. **Clone Repository:** Download or clone the repository."

4. **Enable Developer Mode:** [Enable Developer Mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) on your iOS device.

5. **Open Project:** Launch Xcode on your computer. Ensure you are using the latest version of Xcode.

6. **Select Deployment Target:** Select your connected device as a deployment target.

7. **Install Application:** Click the "Play" button to build and install the app on your chosen deployment target.

8. **Trust Developer:** Before launching the application, you need to trust the developer. [Here is an article](https://support.apple.com/de-at/HT204460#:~:text=Tippe%20auf%20%22Einstellungen%22%20%3E%20%22,f%C3%BCr%20diesen%20Entwickler%20zu%20etablieren.) on trusting the developer.

**Note:** Ensure that the repository file is obtained from a trusted source, and you have the necessary permissions to install third-party apps on your iOS device.
